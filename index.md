# 3DOF planar motion concept

- Rotational inputs only
- Stationary actuators give parallel kinematic advantages

# Reulaux Triangle planar motion concept

- Makes use of relative motion between centres of mass of circular and Relaux triangle shaped gears. 
- Inverse kinematics that include differential equations? Sounds good.
