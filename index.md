# 3 Degree of freedom planar motion concept

- Rotational inputs only
- Stationary actuators give parallel kinematic advantages

# Actuating two degrees of freedom with a single actuator. 

Ok, the heading above is a bit of a lie, but hear me out. 

Consider the mechanism below. 
- The plate initally highlighted is constrained to move in a plane without rotational degrees of freedom.
- The mechanism makes use of three linear actuators to achieve motion

- In the first configuation, the plate initially highlighted is fixed in space (The translational degrees of freedom are removed). This could be achived with the used of for instance a hydraulic brake. 
- The mechanism now has two rotational degrees of freedom and one translational degree of freedom.


- The "brake" is now removed from the plate, and it regains its translational degrees of freedom.
- The brake is now applied to the universal joint in the centre of the end effector.

- The mechanism now has three translational degrees of freedom.

Ok so what? Well, if we consider the brake to be a single actuator



# Reulaux Triangle planar motion concept

- Makes use of relative motion between centers of mass of circular and Reulaux triangle-shaped gears. 
- Inverse kinematics that include differential equations? Sounds good.
